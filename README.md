# Node + TypeScript

Fast and close-to-production way to develop with Node and TypeScript.
Inspired by [Ben Awad](https://youtu.be/I6ypD7qv3Z8).

I've combined the nodemon and tsc script to a single dev script for convenience.

Enjoy!

## Quickstart

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Install Yarn

```shell
npm i -g yarn
```

Initialize and install dependencies

```shell
yarn
```

Run development

```shell
yarn run dev
```

You'll get some errors - don't worry.

Open `src/index.ts`, change the console log message and save the file.
